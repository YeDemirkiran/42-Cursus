(FIXED)1 - EOF: Entering with no chars, or writing some part of EOF will still count as EOF
	Note: If EOF is empty, on real heredoc, entering an empty file counts as EOF. Don't forget to keep it.

2 - When the heredoc line is too long, it will print the > char multiple times

3 - Too long heredoc seems to be working fine

4 - Opening too many processes result in (Too many files) error. The limit seems to be BUFFER_SIZE / 2

(FIXED)5 - It can handle it if infile is "" (empty) or doesn't exist. But if it's empty, then the message is bash: doesn't exist.
	The real bash prints an extra column.

(FIXED)6 - When a command is empty, nothing is printed. But the real shell prints an error message (not found).

(INENTIONAL)7 - When any file or command is not found, it returns 0 instead of 1. It returns the last exit status of the last command, matching the real shell behavior.

(FIXED)8 - When the output file is "" (empty) or a directory, error message starts with "pipex: open". It should start like "bash: ", like the real bash.

9 - Weird things happen after exceeding the buffer size on each here_doc line
